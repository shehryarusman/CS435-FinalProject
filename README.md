To run the code, run main.m where at the top of main.m you will find the 2 filepaths of the images you're going to use. The script will take a minute or two to run on images <1MB, and it will output and save the figures I used for all parts of the writeup. All files will be outputted in your local directory based on the filename of the files you chose.

There may be some duplicate figures created which we couldn't fix due to time constraints, but all figures displayed are included in the writeup pdf
